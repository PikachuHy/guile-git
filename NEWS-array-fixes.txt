* Forward incompatible changes

Applying these changes will make your program work with this version of
Guile and continue working with older versions.

** vector->list and vector-copy require a true vector argument.

Use array->list and array-copy (from (ice-9 arrays)) on general arrays.

** scm_vector_elements / scm_vector_writable_elements require a true vector argument.

Use scm_array_get_handle and scm_array_handle_elements /
scm_array_handle_writable_elements on general arrays.

* Backward incompatible changes

Applying these changes will make your program work with this version of
Guile and STOP working with older versions.

** scm_array_p takes a single argument.

This function used to take a second unused argument for the sake of
compatibility with older versions of Guile. Just remove this argument from your
calls.
