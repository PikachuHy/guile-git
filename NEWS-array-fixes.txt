(vector-array-handle-plan for Guile 3.0) -*- coding: utf-8; mode: org; -*-

TBA to NEWS for this branch.

 
* Forward incompatible changes

Applying these changes will make your program work with this version of
Guile and continue working with older versions, at least back to 2.2.

** vector->list and vector-copy require a true vector argument.

Use array->list and array-copy (from (ice-9 arrays)) on general arrays.

** scm_vector_elements / scm_vector_writable_elements require a true vector argument.

Use scm_array_get_handle and scm_array_handle_elements /
scm_array_handle_writable_elements on general arrays.

** scm_is_simple_vector has been removed.

Use scm_is_vector instead.


* Backward incompatible changes

Applying these changes will make your program work with this version of
Guile and STOP working with older versions.

** scm_array_p takes a single argument.

This function used to take a second unused argument for the sake of
compatibility with older versions of Guile. Just remove this argument from your
calls.

** SCM_SIMPLE_VECTOR_REF, SCM_SIMPLE_VECTOR_SET and SCM_SIMPLE_VECTOR_LENGTH have been renamed.

Use SCM_VECTOR_REF, SCM_VECTOR_SET and SCM_VECTOR_LENGTH instead.


* Rationale / TODO

** Fix API for scm_vector_elements scm_vector_writable_elements to [(SCM vec) -> pointer]

  - incp is always one on these types, so it isn't needed
  - no need to acquire/release an array handle for VECTOR_TYPE
  - remove the dependence of vector.c bitvector.c bytevector.c etc. on array-handle.h

** Remove scm_is_simple_vector, fix scm_is_array_p, rename SIMPLE_VECTOR  to VECTOR, etc.

  - just cleaning house

** vector-move-right!, vector-move-left!, either

  - work only on vector type, use array-copy! and make-shared-array (or future slicing facility) for general arrays
  - rename to array-move... and make type generic
  - remove entirely and just use array-copy!

** basic rank-1 ops on VECTOR_TYPEs need (len begin inc) instead of (begin end)

  - look at CBLAS/BLIS
  - this is a problem because all the RnRS & SRFIs use (begin end) :-(
